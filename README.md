# Hat Systems
Hat Systems is a general purpose storage system for workshop storage of tools and inventory.

Designed with these basic principles in mind; modular, low-cost, heavy-duty/durable and spacious. The module sizes is designed to fit onto [EUR-palett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet), with a footprint size of 120x80 centimeter. This allows them to be moved around easily in an production or workshop environment, or even transported between locations.

Originally developed as for use in-house at [Fellesverkstedet](http://fellesverkstedet.no), now also in use at [Bitraf](http://bitraf.no), and open for reproduction across the world.

## Modules

### Rack

The base module, which drawers fit into.

Made of 18mm OSB.

Is put together with 8 countersunk socket head M8 x 50mm bolts and square nuts M8 x 13 x 5MM (DIN 7991/ISO 10462).
The countersunk bolts facilitates placing two units side by side on a pallett.

The rack is assembled with bolts in order to make it possible to dissasemble for transport. But could theoretically be glued or screwed together as well.

### Drawer Regular

Regular drawer that will fit most stuff.

### Drawer BigOne

Supersized drawer, takes the place of two regular drawers in height. Otherwise identical to Drawer Regular.

### Bridge

Forms a solid surface on top of two racks, as well as housing for two regular drawers.
Useful to create a working sturface, with height comfortable for standing work.

## TODO

* Rack: Remove mostly-unused bolt holes in sides. They stay still by their own weight.
* Publish sources and assembly drawing for `Material Storage`
