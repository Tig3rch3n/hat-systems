# Hat Systems
Hat Systems is a general purpose storage system for workshop storage of tools and inventory.

Designed with these basic principles in mind; modular, low-cost, heavy-duty/durable and spacious. The module sizes is designed to fit onto [EUR-palett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet), with a footprint size of 120x80 centimeter. This allows them to be moved around easily in an production or workshop environment, or even transported between locations.

Originally developed as for use in-house at [Fellesverkstedet](http://fellesverkstedet.no), now also in use at [Bitraf](http://bitraf.no), and open for reproduction across the world.

## RACK
