# Hat Systems
Hat Systems is a general purpose storage system originally developed as an in-house solution for workshop storage of tools and inventory.

Designed with these basic principles in mind; modular, low-cost, heavy-duty/durable and spacious. The Europallettsystem dictates the size as it's made to be placed in clusters of up to 6? on a pallett in order to be moved around easily in an production or workshop environment.

RACK
Is put together with 8 countersunk socket head M8 50mm DIN 7991/ISO 10462 bolts and square nuts (M8 x 13 x 5MM). The countersunk bolts facilitates placing two units side by side on a pallett. It's bolted together in order to make it possible to dissasemble for transport. But could theoretically be glued or screwed together as well. 

DRAWERS
Made of 12mm OSB, as well as 5mm MDF for drawer bottoms. 

Several extensions and options exist;

Regular	- regular drawer that will fit most stuff
Big One	- supersized drawer, takes the place of two regular drawers in height
Bridge	- forms a solid surface on top of two racks, as well as housing for two regular drawers
