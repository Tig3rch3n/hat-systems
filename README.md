# Hat Systems
Hat Systems is a general purpose storage system for workshop storage of tools and inventory.

Designed with these basic principles in mind; modular, low-cost, heavy-duty/durable and spacious. The module sizes is designed to fit onto [EUR-palett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet), with a footprint size of 120x80 centimeter. This allows them to be moved around easily in an production or workshop environment, or even transported between locations.

Originally developed as for use in-house at [Fellesverkstedet](http://fellesverkstedet.no), now also in use at [Bitraf](http://bitraf.no), and open for reproduction across the world.

Conceptualized for Fellesverkstedet by [Hans Christian Skovholt](http://www.skovholt.net/) and Graham A. Hayward.

Modules have been produced by Jonas SÃ¦tervik, [Siemen Cuypupeiers](http://www.siemencuypers.com) and Anthony Poldervaart. And by Thomas Winther at Bitraf.

## Example configurations

### Storage shelves

Per palett: `2x2 Rack`, with  `3x Drawer Regular` in most of the racks.

![Storage shelves at Fellesverkstedet](./images/storage-shelves.jpg)

## Prerequisites for making
You will need accesss to a large-scale CNC mill/router, capable of handling cutsheets of at least 60x80 cm (120x80 for current bridge design),
and cutting 18 mm [OSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_strand_board).
Examples include the Shopbot PRS, or an extended Shapeoko/XCarve.

If you don't have access to such a machine, check out your local [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/map), makerspace or [hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces)! Or find someone to manufacture it for you locally using [Fabhub.io directory](https://www.fabhub.io/directory).

Ready-to-use cutsheet geometry is included, but you will need to set up the toolpaths yourself using the CAM software for your machine.

## Modules

[Sketchup project source](./Hat_Systems_assembled.skp), for modifying or creating new modules.

### Rack

The base module, which drawers fit into.

![Rack assembly drawing](./Rack/RACK_v1.0_assembly.png)

Made of 18mm OSB.

Is put together with 8 countersunk socket head M8 x 50mm bolts and square nuts M8 x 13 x 5MM (DIN 7991/ISO 10462).
The countersunk bolts facilitates placing two units side by side on a pallett.

The rack is assembled with bolts in order to make it possible to dissasemble for transport. But could theoretically be glued or screwed together as well.

[.STL 3d-model](./Rack.stl)

### Drawer Regular

Regular drawer that will fit most stuff.

Made of 12mm OSB, as well as 6mm MDF for drawer bottoms.

[.STL 3d-model](./Drawer_regular.stl)

You will also need one drawer bottom.

### Drawer BigOne

Supersized drawer, takes the place of two regular drawers in height. Otherwise identical to Drawer Regular.

[.STL 3d-model](./Drawer_big_one.stl)

You will also need one drawer bottom, see above!

### Bridge

Forms a solid surface on top of two racks, as well as housing for two regular drawers.
Useful to create a working sturface, with height comfortable for standing work.

## Material Storage

Full-width module for storing materials vertically.

**Work-in-progress!** Files should be scrutinized before any attempt to produce.

## TODO

* Material Storage: Finish/verify files, mark complete.
* Rack: Remove mostly-unused bolt holes in sides. They stay still by their own weight.
* Add a template .SVG file for drawer label (for ease of making on laser/printer)
